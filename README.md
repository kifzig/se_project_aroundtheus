**Intro**

With this website, view some of the most beautiful places in the U.S. through pictures. This project uses grid and flex box to show cards at different screen sizes using @media queries. It follows a Figma design below. It has other features like rounded corners and a round profile picture using border-radius. It is my first intentional attempt at responsive design.

This project is a work in progress and there are plans to add the ability to add photos to the gallery soon as well as more compatibility with more devices.
